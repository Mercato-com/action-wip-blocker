# Auto Block WIP PRs 

A GitHub Action that blocks PRs that are tagged by WIP (et al) or have WIP in their title. A fail fast method to remind the reviewer that the current PR is still a work in progress and should not be merged.

Scans labels and title of the PR and fails if it encounters any of the blocked words in them.

Extended to also block a PR if the REQUIRED_LIST is provided and the PR does not have a label that matches any of the values (note that only labels are checked and not the title)

## Usage

If this solves your problems adding it to your project is straightforward 

```workflow
name: WIP Checker

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - development
    types: [labeled, unlabeled, edited, opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  check_wip:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Block if WIP PR
      uses: ParanoidBeing/action-wip-blocker@v0.1.1
      env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          BLOCK_LIST: "WIP|do not merge|backend not live"
          REQUIRED_LIST: "release"
```

Depending on your project's requrirements you may add / remove triggers and/or branches [Pull request events](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request)
